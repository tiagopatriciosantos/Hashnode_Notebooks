When we first start, we'll see a pop-up window below. Alternatively, we can add services from our cloudspace dashboard, where we'll also see the available resources in our cloudspace. There are three ways to add services to our cloudspace, we will use a pre-configured service template to create our FastAPI:\n\n![](https://api.mogenius.com/file/id/1d25d25c-2715-4a3e-8201-ec8ceac94cef)\n\n\nWith this option, mogenius will automatically create and add a boilerplate FastAPI template to your Git repository, allowing you to start coding in the newly created repo or to use existing code. Browse the service library or use the search function to find the FastAPI service, then click \"Add service.\"\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6saPc3S.png)\n\nNext, if this is the first time you are deploying a service, we need to connect your cloudspace to your repository. Click on “Continue with GitHub,” which will prompt you to grant permission to access your GitHub repositories. You will only need to do this once, as your mogenius cloudspace will now be connected to your GitHub account and can access your repositories.\n\nNext, we create a new repository by clicking “+ Add repository.” Select a name for the new repository and create it. By default, this will also be the name of our service, but we can also change it to a different name.\n\nWe can leave all settings at default for now, as we can change them at any point later when the service is up and running.\n\nNow, simply click \"Create Service.\" Our FastAPI boilerplate template will be built, added to the specified Git repository, and deployed to our cloudspace simultaneously, allowing to start using it almost immediately. Once the setup routines, build, and deployment process are complete (usually only a few minutes), we can start coding in our repository and access our FastAPI at the specified hostname. Every time we commit any changes to our repository, it will trigger a new build-deploy process automatically (CI/CD).\n\nWe can find all the details on our service's overview page, view metrics, access service logs, add resources, and add additional instances for our service (Kubernetes pods).\n\nThat's it! We have created the FastAPI service, and it will be available to access by other services via the internal hostname that has been assigned to our service, e.g. fastapi-template-8b4tp5:3000. We will choose to expose this service, we will have an external hostname that can be accessed from outside our cloudspace, it looks like this: fastapi-template-prod-myaccount-afooyl.mo2.mogenius.io:80\n\nIf we go to the Github repository we can see the result of this creation:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rBdT99U.png)\n\n\n\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"530637cf-0c64-472c-a369-71ba7a10d400"},{"source":"## MLFlow changing stage to production\n\n\nNow let's put our model in the \"Production\" stage, we will use the production stage model to deploy into our WebAPI.\n\nAccess into the MLFlow UI:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yaJNfXf.png)\n\n\nOpen the model:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7C1dsFD.png)\n\n\nSet into production:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/97G507c.png)\n\nSay \"OK\" and voilá.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yW9kOnn.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d43472c1-8e68-4c31-a22b-853929ac9024"},{"source":"## Cloning the FastAPI Project\n\nLet's now clone the repository into our local machine, copying the clone command on Github repository.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rBdT99U.png)\n\n\nExecute this commands in the command line:\n```console\ncd path/to/folder\ngit clone https://github.com/tiagopatriciosantos/FastApiFakeJobPost.git\ncd FastApiFakeJobPost\n```\n\nWith VS Code already installed we can now run:\n```console\ncode .\n```\n\nThat will open the VS Code editor.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cf8f232d-752e-4ef6-9733-e7ac001ddd01"},{"source":"## Creating a virtual python environment\n\nTo create and activate our virtual python environment using venv, type the following commands into your terminal (still in the project folder):\n\n\nLinux/Mac\n```console\npython3 -m venv .venv\necho .venv/ >> .gitignore\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\nWindows\n```powershell\npython3 -m venv .venv\necho .venv/ >> .gitignore\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n```\n\n\nThe first command creates the virtual environment - a directory named .venv, located inside your project directory, where all the Python packages used by the project will be installed without affecting the rest of your computer.\n\nThe second command activates the virtual python environment, which ensures that any python packages we use don't contaminate our global python installation.\n\nThe rest of this tutorial should be executed in the same shell session.\nIf exit the shell session or want to create another, we need to make sure to activate the virtual environment in that shell session first.\n\n\n\n## Installing requirements\nTo install the requirements open the requirements.txt and place the text inside with these direct dependencies:\n```plaintext\npydantic>=1.8.0,<2.0.0\nuvicorn==0.20.0\nfastapi==0.89.1\npandas==1.5.3\nscikit-learn==1.2.0\nrich==13.3.0\nmlflow==2.1.1\npython-multipart==0.0.5\npython-dotenv==0.21.1\n```\n\nNow, to install type:\n```console\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fa5ac6f5-df3e-4374-a191-3cb509954dfe"},{"source":"## Load and serve the model\n\n### `app/main.py`\n\nOpen and put the fowling code into `app/main.py` file.\n\nThis Python code defines a FastAPI application that loads a pre-trained ML model and uses it to make predictions on input data provided by a user through a CSV file.\n\nThe code imports the following modules:\n\n- `FastAPI`: A web framework for building APIs quickly and easily.\n- `File` and `UploadFile` from FastAPI: These are used for handling file uploads in the application.\n- `HTTPException` from FastAPI: This is used to raise HTTP exceptions when there are errors in the application.\n- `mlflow` A machine learning platform for managing the ML lifecycle, including experiment tracking, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.\n- `pandas`: A library for data manipulation and analysis.\n- `print` from `rich`: A library for pretty-printing information to the console.\n\nThe code defines a `Model` class to store the pre-trained model and use it for prediction.
